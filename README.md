# ðŸ¦¾ MachineLearning
Machine Learning (COMP130172) course of Fudan University, Fall 2023. Instructed by Professor [Mingmin Chi](https://datascience.fudan.edu.cn/e1/6f/c13398a123247/page.htm)

## Assignment 1: K-Nearest Neighbours
- Using the k-NN for classification based on MNIST dataset available at [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) or on wine quality available at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/shelvigarg/wine-quality-dataset/)

## Assignment 2: Regression for Housing Price Predictions
- Design different regression models to predict housing prices based on Boston price dataset, which can be downloaded directly on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vikrishnan/boston-house-prices) or loaded on [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/1.0/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_boston.html)
- You should at least try Ridge Regression & Lasso regression


## Assignment 3: SVM
- Based on [MNIST dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hojjatk/mnist-dataset/data), use SVM classifier to classify the handwritten digits.


## Assignment 4: SVR
- Using support vector regression to predict housing prices. The data is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/vikrishnan/boston-house-prices)
